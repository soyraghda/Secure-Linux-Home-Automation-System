# Secure-Linux-Home-Automation-System
 This project aims to create a secure linux distribution for a home smart system, the whole project was implemented on a virtual machine and the linux distribution was developed using The Yocto Project.

Threat Model
=============

Context
-------

This threat model focuses on the security considerations for a Linux embedded system that forms a crucial part of a home automation network. Home automation systems typically include a diverse range of interconnected devices, such as smart thermostats, lighting controls, security cameras, door locks, and entertainment systems, all of which rely on embedded Linux systems for their operation. By examining the potential threats and the actors responsible for them, this model aims to evaluate the associated risks of deploying and operating such a system in a home environment.

Threats and Risks
-----------------
- **Physical Access**: Unauthorized physical access to the devices could lead to tampering or direct exploitation. For example, an attacker gaining physical access to a smart door lock might be able to manipulate it to gain entry into the home.
- **Remote Access**: Remote exploitation of network vulnerabilities could allow attackers to control the system. For instance, attackers exploiting a vulnerability in the SSH server software running on the home network might gain remote access to all connected IoT devices.
- **Theft of User Data**: Sensitive user data could be stolen through various attack vectors. For example, if a hacker breaches the cloud server hosting user data from smart home devices, they could access personal information or surveillance footage.
- **Software Applications**: Users installing unauthorized software could introduce vulnerabilities or malware. For instance, downloading third-party mobile apps that claim to enhance home automation functionality but contain malicious code could compromise the security of the entire system.
- **Override System Security**: Users attempting to bypass security measures to access restricted features. For example, disabling two-factor authentication on a smart home app to simplify access could leave the system vulnerable to unauthorized access.

Threat Agents
-------------
- **TA01: Hackers**
  Individuals or groups with malicious intent, seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the home automation system for various purposes, including theft, espionage, or disruption of services.

- **TA02: Insiders**
  Authorized users with malicious intent, such as disgruntled family members, service technicians, or former employees, who may abuse their privileges to manipulate or sabotage the system.

- **TA03: Malware**
  Software designed to infiltrate, damage, or disrupt the home automation system, including ransomware, viruses, and trojans.

- **TA04: Eavesdroppers**
  Individuals or entities attempting to intercept or monitor communication between devices or users within the home automation system, potentially for unauthorized access or information gathering.

- **TA05: Physical Intruders**
  Individuals attempting to gain physical access to the smart devices or home network infrastructure, either for theft, vandalism, or to compromise the system's security.

Possible Threat Scenarios
-------------------------
To harden the operating system against potential threats, the following scenarios should be considered:

1. **Remote Attacks**:

  * Unauthorized access to the home automation system could lead to the compromise of sensitive data, such as user credentials, personal information, or surveillance footage.
  * Attackers gaining control over IoT devices could manipulate device settings, disrupt device functionality, or use devices for malicious purposes, such as surveillance or DDoS attacks.
  * Injection of malicious commands into the home automation network could result in unauthorized actions, such as unlocking doors, disabling security cameras, or adjusting thermostat settings, posing physical security risks to occupants.


2. **Untrusted User: Software Attacks (Insider)**:
   
  * Installation of unauthorized software or apps could result in the theft of sensitive user data stored within the home automation system, such as access codes, schedules, or personal preferences.
  * Malware infections on user devices could lead to the compromise of user credentials, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the home automation system and associated devices.
  * Unauthorized software or apps may also introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the system, enabling attackers to exploit weaknesses for further infiltration or control.
   
3. **Local Attacks: Physical Access**:

  * Physical theft of IoT devices could result in unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the home or premises, compromising physical security measures implemented through the automation system.
  * Insertion of malicious USB sticks or hardware implants could lead to the compromise of device integrity, unauthorized access, or the extraction of sensitive information, such as network credentials or encryption keys.
  * Unauthorized modification of firmware or software on IoT devices could result in device malfunction, rendering them inoperable or susceptible to exploitation by attackers.

4. **Untrusted Administrator: Administrator Role Access**:

  * Compromise of administrative credentials could result in the unauthorized modification of system settings, including device configurations, network access controls, or user permissions.
  * Manipulation of system configuration settings by unauthorized administrators could disrupt device functionality, compromise system integrity, or expose sensitive data to unauthorized access or theft.
  * Abuse of administrative privileges to install unauthorized software or firmware updates could introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the system, posing security risks to all connected devices and occupants.
## Assets to Protect

Hypotheses
-----------

- We have listed all possible threats. Nevertheless, the secure boot is not considered in this project. We make the hypothesis that the boot is secured.

- The security objectives should also consider the development phase of the system. The development environment must be isolated and secure. Access to the environment must be the subject of particular attention. We make the hypothesis that the environment is isolated and secure during the development phase of the system.

- The password security objective should also consider the passwords for service accounts (web services, etc.). We make the hypothesis that we trust service provider and that the security policies are applied to the service accounts.
